In order to keep costs low and to ensure the organic growth of the project, they mostly use local materials that are readily accessible to homeowners. Each stove is custom made to accommodate the cooking pots used in the home. The project emphasizes personal and community ownership, which ensures that the stoves will continue to be used for years to come. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Amherst College Public Health Collaborative will be holding a conversation about how this project marries sustainability and health, and also how cooking affects womens' and childrens' health in developing countries.\u00a0</p>",
